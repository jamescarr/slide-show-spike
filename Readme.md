# HTML5Rocks Remote Spike
This is a quick spike of an idea I've had to remotely control a web based slide deck.

## Running it
Type "npm install" from the project root
Type "node app.js"

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in one browser
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/remote in another browser

Click on Next and Previous ;)
